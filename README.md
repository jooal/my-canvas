### The Game
This game is built following the MDN "2D breakout game using Javascript" tutorial. It incorporates simple HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery. This tutorial provides clear, step-by-step instructions. It is crucial to understand the functionality behind the code as there is a lot of embedding of functions, if-else statments, and objects.

### My Experience
I experienced a few minor problems following this tutorial, which required me to debug certain parts of my code to get functions running properly. The tutorial does not include Jquery, but I included Jquery strategies to simplify some parts of the code.
